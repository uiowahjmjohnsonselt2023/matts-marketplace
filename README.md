## Project Description
Matt's Marketplace is a platform where people will be able to buy
and sell items of their choosing. Users will be able to log in and make 
posts with items that they intend to sale and browse through items that 
others are selling. The goal of Matt's Marketplace is to easily connect 
people looking to buy items and people looking to sell those items within
the same region. In the site, users will also be able to search and filter
for specific items and message sellers/buyers.

## Features
The main features of the marketplace will be:
- User profiles.
- Search/Browse/Filter page for looking at items being sold.
- Sell page for users looking to sell items they own.
- User-to-user messaging for coordinating between buyers and sellers.
- Review system for users to review items and/or other users.
- Users with Admin privileges will have full control over posts and users.
- Users will be able to look at their order history and their sell history.
- Users can wishlist items to save them.
- Admins can collect revenue from transactions & featured items payment.
- Upload images for items & profiles.
- Forced profile information.
- BDD & TDD tested.

The marketplace will also (hopefully) have other smaller features, 
but these are the main ones.

## Business Model
Matt's Marketplace will have two main sources of income. 
The first will be taking a small commission on every payment that goes through the app.
The second will be offering paid ads and paid priority listings.
This would then be a hybrid between the business model of something like Craig's List and ebay.
